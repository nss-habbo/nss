</strong><br><em>What do we do within this division?
<br>
<br>â€‹The Transfer Team is an perfect example of a division which helps handle all transfers coming in to NSS. Participating as part of this team will allow you to be a better communicator, watch new members grow and progress within the agency. If you are willing to step out, communicate and support new members through the journey here at NSS. Then this is the division for you. Join Transfer Team today, Make a difference!
<br>
<br>Meet the the transfer team leadership:
<br>Director -
<br>Head - 
<br>Chief -
<br>
<br>If you wish to apply for the team contact a member of the leadership team and they will talk you through the application/training process!
<br>
<br>Transfer Team Rules:
<br>1. If a person has worked in the agency less than 4 days - deny the transfer
<br>2. Check the main badge to see the join date and also check how many members the main badge consists of.
<br>3. If the main badge has less than 500 members deny the transfer.
<br>4. Make sure the member isn't an alliance.
<br>5. If the member has worked here before and is wishing to transfer back. Speak to the leadership team or an iC member to decide what to lower the rank offer to.
<br>
<br>To complete a transfer its fairly simple. We begin by checking the main badge, for how many members it consists of and when they joined that current agency. Secondly, we check promotion logs to see if they have worked here before. We check the website to the current agency they are working for and offer them an equivalent within our agency. In example a Manager in "UN" can gain Management status here in NSS. Unless however they have worked here before then we check with an iC or Transfer Team leadership member which division we should lower it too. If no members are available to help with the lowered offer lower by at least one division.
